        <p>Have you ever seen these stunning images of cells: the background is black and the cellular structures are outlined with bright neon colours.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/IHC_example.JPG" alt="immunohistochemistry example" style="display: block;     margin-left: auto;     margin-right: auto;     width: 50%;" /></p>

<p>How does someone do that? Well, they could’ve used immunohistochemistry!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-immunohistochemistry">What is Immunohistochemistry?</h2>

<p>Abbreviated to IHC, it simply produces images by highlighting the antibodies’ positions with a marker, like fluorescent dye, and then letting these antibodies bind to antigens. These antigens are specific to certain types of cells, like abnormal heart cells, and when highlighted enable these structures to finally be seen under the microscope.</p>

<p>Scientists have recently been using this technique to screen for Lynch Syndrome, the most common form of hereditary colon cancer. It’s caused by mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH6, MSH2 and PMS2 which prevent them from fixing DNA damage. This can then build up, causing cells to uncontrollably grow, divide, and ultimately become cancerous.</p>

<h2 id="well-how-does-this-screening-work">Well, How Does this Screening Work?</h2>
<p>The IHC screening has been designed to detect the presence of MSH6 and PMS2: if these genes are absent from the sample then the patient is likely to have Lynch Syndrome. Only these two genes are tested as previous studies have demonstrated an equal effectiveness in detecting positive results compared to testing all four genes.</p>

<p>To begin the IHC process however, scientists must get a sample of the suspected tumour and perform tissue fixation which serves to prevent decay by stopping further biochemical reactions from occurring.</p>
